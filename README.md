TCP Header Flags 
TCP port header exercise using C. Header flags + bit shifting used. 

Given a TCP comm, and using the bits transported in the header message, I assosciated what relevant flags are presented in the incoming comm using bitwise operations and a matching array of the common flag abbreviations. Useful for indicating the connection state, and for possible troubleshooting. Though not entirely expanded upon this is a type of foray into socket programming.
